 *
 * ## Help! It didn't work/I found a bug!
 *
 * This extension is based on work by Amy Chan, namely maximus[1] and Window Buttons[2].
 *
 * 1. Make sure you can *reproduce* the bug reliably.
 * 2. Do 'Ctrl + F2' and 'lg' and see if there are any errors produced by Maximus,
 *	both in the 'Errors' window *and* the 'Extensions' > 'Maximus' > 'Show Errors'
 *	tab (the 'Show Errors' is in GNOME 3.4+ only I think).
 * 3. Disable all your extensions except Maximus and see if you can still reproduce
 *	the bug. If so, mention this.
 * 4. If you can't reproduce th bug with all extensions but Maximus disabled, then
 *	gradually enable your extensions one-by-one until you work out which one(s)
 *	together cause the bug, and mention these.
 * 5. Open a new issue at [4].
 * 6. Include how you can reproduce the bug and any relevant information from 2--4.
 * 7. Also include:
 * - your version of the extension (in metadata.json)
 * - list of all your installed extensions (including disabled ones, as
 *   this is no guarantee they won't interfere with other extensions)
 * - your version of GNOME-shell (gnome-shell --version).
 * 8. I'll try get back to you with a fix.
 * (Brownie points: open a terminal, do `gnome-shell --replace` and reproduce the
 *  bug. Include any errors that pop up in this terminal.)
 *
 * ## Note:
 * It's actually possible to get the undecorate-on-maximise behaviour without
 * needing this extension. See the link [5] and in particular, the bit on editing
 * your metacity theme metacity-theme-3.xml. ("Method 2: editing the theme").
